    "The reviews are stored in text files in the local disk. Your script should open those files, process the information to turn it into the format expected by the web service, then send it to the web service to get stored.\n",

Your manager asks you to take those reviews (saved as .txt files) and display them on your company's website. To do this, you'll need to write a script to convert those .txt files and process them into Python dictionaries, then upload the data onto your company's website (currently using Django).\n",
